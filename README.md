# Zoho Deluge Tricks ![alt text]([http://url/to/img.png](https://help.zoho.com/portal/api/departments/4000609360326/logo?portalId=edbsn3b70dd1c6df566ee5b86f9a10b39ac781e714edb9c3a38a191adf0c5b716166e))
Working with Zoho Deluge can be really tricky for some operations that are not documented in their documentations. 
In this repository I want to store small lines of code that can be helpful from day to day.

List of tricks

* [connect_analytics.dg](../main/connect_analytics.dg): get data from a report of Zoho Analytics
* [getRecordsCView.dg](../main/getRecordsCView.dg): list records from a custom view in Zoho CRM 
* [StockInHandAnalytics.sql](../main/StockInHandAnalytics.sql): SQL code to create a report to view the same stock in hand data that appears in Zoho Books (code provided by Zoho, not tested)
