# Zoho Deluge Tricks
Working with Zoho Deluge can be really tricky for some operations that are not documented in their documentations. 
In this repository I want to store small lines of code that are helpful.

List of tricks

* connect_analytics.dg: get data from a report of Zoho Analytics
* getRecordsCView.dg: list records from a custom view in Zoho CRM
