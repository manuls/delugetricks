# ðŸ”° Zoho Deluge Tricks 
Working with Zoho Deluge can be really tricky for some operations that are not documented in their documentations. 
In this repository I want to store small lines of code that can be helpful from day to day.

List of tricks

* [connect_analytics.dg](../main/connect_analytics.dg): get data from a report of Zoho Analytics
* [getRecordsCView.dg](../main/getRecordsCView.dg): list records from a custom view in Zoho CRM 
* [StockInHandAnalytics.sql](../main/StockInHandAnalytics.sql): SQL code to create a report to view the same stock in hand data that appears in Zoho Books (code provided by Zoho, not tested) 
* [update_record.dg](../main/update_record.dg): Deluge Script to update a row in Zoho Creator
* [wait.dg](../main/wait.dg): Deluge Script adapted for Zoho Creator that creates a pause in the execution. Credits to julien from Zoho Community: https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/community/user/4006985205586
