# Zoho Deluge Tricks
Working with Zoho Deluge can be really tricky for some operations that are not documented in their documentations. 
In this repository I want to store small lines of code that are helpful.

List of tricks

* [connect_analytics.dg](../blob/main/connect_analytics.dg): get data from a report of Zoho Analytics
* [I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)
* getRecordsCView.dg: list records from a custom view in Zoho CRM
